# 🏨 Hotel Sobana Management System

A fully integrated hotel management system built for **Hotel Sobana, Udawalawa**, replacing their previous manual processes with a streamlined, automated solution.

This system was developed as part of the **2nd-year 2nd-semester ITP module**, using the **MERN Stack** with REST APIs and several key dependencies. Our main goal was to modernize hotel operations with real-time, online management capabilities.
